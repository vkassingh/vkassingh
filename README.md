### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Currently working as an SDE at DataValley, I lead frontend efforts while specializing in scalable backend systems. With 1.5 years of experience across Web, App, and Blockchain development, Iâ€™ve contributed to impactful projects by clean architecture, automation, and solving real-world problems through code. Outside of tech, Iâ€™m into football, and sports. You can mail me [vkassingh](mailto:44vikasrajput44@gmail.com)
